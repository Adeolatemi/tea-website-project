# Personal Website — Alawode Temitope Adeola

This repository contains a minimal, responsive single-page personal website created to meet the application requirements for **Tech Expert Academy (TEA)**.

## Project Overview
The website presents a brief personal profile, learning motivation, interests, and contact information. It is built using core web technologies and follows semantic HTML, accessibility, and responsive design best practices.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — semantic and accessible HTML structure
- `styles.css` — responsive styling using Flexbox and CSS Grid
- `script.js` — ES6 JavaScript for basic interactivity

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5** — semantic markup
- **CSS3** — Flexbox, Grid, custom properties
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — DOM manipulation and UI behavior
- **Google Fonts** — Inter

## Features
- Responsive layout for **mobile (320px)**, **tablet (768px)**, and **desktop (1024px+)**
- Semantic HTML structure using modern HTML5 elements
- Accessible navigation with skip link and keyboard support
- Light and dark theme toggle with preference persisted in `localStorage`
- Smooth scrolling for in-page navigation
- Contact form with client-side validation and user feedback

## Accessibility & Best Practices
- Proper use of semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `aside`, `footer`)
- Visible focus styles for keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes applied only where necessary
- Clean, readable, and maintainable codebase
- Responsive design implemented with mobile-first principles

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Serve locally (recommended for ES modules):
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` → open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
   - Node: `npx http-server -p 8000` or `npx serve`
   - Or use the Live Server extension in VS Code

## Application blurb (paste into TEA application)
Hi — my name is Alawode Temitope Adeola. I have experience with front-end stacks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and have built responsive web interfaces. I'm now ready to learn backend development (APIs, databases, server-side architecture) and believe Tech Expert Academy (TEA) is the right place to help me transition to full-stack/backend development. My personal site: https://adeolatemi.github.io/tea-website-project/

## Summary

This project demonstrates my understanding of frontend web development fundamentals, including semantic HTML, responsive design, accessibility, and basic JavaScript interactivity. I'm now focusing on expanding into backend development and building end-to-end applications.
